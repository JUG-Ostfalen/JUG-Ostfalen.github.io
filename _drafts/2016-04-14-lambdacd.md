Your applications are code. Your infrastructure is code. And your pipeline? 
The thing that builds your artifacts, that runs your tests, that deploys your code into production? 
You probably still click around in your favorite build server to configure it! There is a better 
way: Build your own build server in clojure! It has power, flexibility, version control, dependency 
management, refactorings, tool support and testing! 

In this talk, I will show you how to do it, 
why clojure is a great fit and how a large organisation uses it successfully to release working 
software several times a day.


Florian is a consultant with [ThoughtWorks in Hamburg](https://www.thoughtworks.com/), 
working in Software Development and 
Platform Engineering. In his free time, he is the maintainer of LambdaCD, an open source toolbox 
to create build pipelines in Clojure code.
