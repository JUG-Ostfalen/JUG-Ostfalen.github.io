NoSql is a buzzword that covers a lot of different technolgies and strategies for data so tonight we are going to dive
into one particular area: schema-less data stores and in particular document databases. We are going to try and create
a webapp backed by MongoDB (a well-known document database), the catch being that we are not going to know what the
application is going to do until we start taking suggestions from the audience.

Hopefully this way we can answer your questions about document stores and see if schema-less data offers the agility
it promises.
