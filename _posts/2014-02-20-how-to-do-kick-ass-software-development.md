With Kick-Ass Software Development you actually get stuff done. Feedback cycles are short, code quality is awesome and
customers get the features they lust after. Less mangers managing, less testers testing and less IT-operators operating.
The developers take the power back, making them much happier. Sound like paradise? It is! This session will show you
how we do Kick-Ass Software Development at Atlassian. I will talk about how we: use pull requests for better code
quality; collaborate fast to develop ideas; avoid meetings to get more stuff done; tighten our feedback loops to fail
faster; shorten our release cycles; and work together happily on different continents. Itâ€™s a great way to develop
software and we think it can work in your company, too.
