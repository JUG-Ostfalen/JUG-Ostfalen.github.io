Generative AI burst on to the public scene in November 2022, over
ten years after Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning premiered on
Coursera. Java developers have long felt like second class
citizens, compared to the cool Python kids. LangChain4J changes the
game. Java is cool with AI now!

This lecture from 30-year industry
veteran Ed Burns explores why it took so long for Java developers
to have access to easy-to-use AI libraries, compared to Python
developers. LangChain4J is the most popular of the Java libraries,
but others exist.
After a brief look at the landscape, we’ll take a
deeper look at LangChain4J and how you use it to perform the most
popular AI usage pattern: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG
is basically a way to bring your own domain specific data to an
existing AI model, and benefit from its power.
