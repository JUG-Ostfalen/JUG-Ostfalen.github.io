*(Keine Sorge Markus spricht bestimmt Deutsch, wenn wir ihn lieb bitten ;-)*

Microservices-based architectures are en-vogue. The last couple of
years we have learned how the thought-leaders implement them, and
every other week we have heard about how containers and
Platform-as-a-Service offerings make them ultimately happen.

The problem is that the developers are almost forgotten and left alone
with provisioning and continuous delivery systems, containers and
resource schedulers, and frameworks and patterns to help slice
existing monoliths. How can we get back in control and efficiently
develop them without having to provision complete production-like
environments locally, by hand?

All the new buzzwords, frameworks and hyped tools have made us forget
ourselves—Java developers–and what it means to be productive and have
fun building systems. The problem that we set out to solve is: how can
we run real-world Microservices-based systems on our local development
machines, managing provisioning and orchestration of potentially
hundreds of services directly from a single command line tool, without
sacrificing productivity enablers like hot code reloading and instant
turnaround time?

During this talk you'll experience first hand how much fun it can be
to develop large-scale Microservices-based systems. You will learn a
lot about what it takes to fail fast and recover and truly understand
the power of a fully integrated Microservices development environment.
 
**Markus Eisele** 
 is a Java Champion, former Java EE Expert Group member,
 Java community leader of German DOAG, founder of JavaLand, reputed
 speaker at Java conferences around the world, and a very well known
 figure in the Enterprise Java world. He works for Lightbend.
 You’ve known and seen him at different conferences and Java User
 Groups meetups or read his blogs or are following his social media
 presence. While talking about middleware for many years you’ll
 continue to hear him talk about enterprise grade Java going forward.
 Focussed on education about the latest trends in building enterprise
 systems in a reactive way with Java.
 He’s been looking into containers and microservices architectures more
 deeply and also wrote a book about modern Java EE Design Patterns with
 O’Reily. He is excited to educate more about how microservices
 architectures can integrate and complement existing platforms, and
 will also talk about how to successfully build resilient applications
 with Java.
