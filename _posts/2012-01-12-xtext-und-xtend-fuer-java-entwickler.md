# Xtend - A Programming Language for Java Developers

Are you waiting for closures in Java 8 or hoping for more type inference in Java 9? Thinking about switching to Scala
or even holding your horses for Ceylon or Kotlin? How about keeping Java where it seems fit, but replacing just its
outdated parts with a concise and modern language? What about an enhancement to Java instead of yet another attempt to
hire a killer.

Xtend is an an open-source programming language hosted at Eclipse.org and built for Java developers. It reuses Java's
keywords, terminology and concepts as much as possible, but abandons some dead freight at the same time.
Xtend is a very powerful alternative for implementing Java classes and works great with all the existing libraries.
Since the language can be seen as a little complementary add-on to Java, it offers many modern language features that
you are currently missing in your daily work. Xtend comes with a variety of goodies reaching from type inference over
closures and extension methods up to smart string interpolation that make development great fun, again. And of course
there is powerful Eclipse IDE integration available.In this session we will demonstrate why Xtend is so great for
everyday programming. You will get an in-depth impression of the seamless integration with the Eclipse Java IDE and
you'll get an impression of the expressiveness and conciseness of Xtend.

# Xtext - Domain-Specific Languages for Java Developers

Programming is great fun. Doing so in your own programming language even more so! Seriously, inventing yet another
general purpose programming language is rarely a good idea. However, as you can imagine, Java isn't the best choice in
every case either. A small language well-suited to solve a specialized task concisely can improve the productivity of a
whole team by orders of magnitude.In this session you'll learn how easy it is to create a highly expressive, statically
typed domain-specific language with the help of the [Xtext framework](http://www.xtext.org). The good news is that
you'll end up not only with a fully-functional compiler but also a top-notch IDE as icing.
All this and more for free, as in beer.
