Wearable computers are one of the next big things. But at the moment, one can only buy 
specialized systems such as motion trackers, GPS watches, and the like. So why not use 
existing cheap technology to build your own wearable Java-powered device? 

This session 
shows what you can do with affordable technology and Java today. It uses an Odroid-W in 
combination with a heart rate sensor, a GPS sensor and a BMP180 to track the heart rate 
and location of a runner. The battery-powered device measures the data and publishes it 
via MQTT to different clients such as Java(FX)-based desktop clients and a smartwatch 
the runner can wear. Come get some ideas of what you can do with Java and wearable devices.

Nicht irritieren lassen von dem englischen Abstract, Gerrit Grunwald macht das für uns sicherlich auf Deutsch.
