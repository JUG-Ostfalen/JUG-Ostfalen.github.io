The Healthcare situation in cities might be good but for the elderly population on the country
side it is often problematic.
In this session it will be shown how one can use a mobile phone and a smart watch in combination
with a Java based gateway, iBeacons and other sensors to monitor the activity of elderly people.
With the help of an IoT Cloud Service this data can be analyzed to detect situations that might be
critical (illness, bone fracture etc.). If such a case was detected the Cloud Service can trigger
Enterprise applications. With this approach it might be possible to connect such a system to
existing Healthcare Applications. This session will give you an idea on how you can combine
existing technologies to do something useful and help elderly people in case of an emergency.

Nicht von dem Englischen Abstrakt irritieren lassen, wir bekommen den Vortrag sicherlich auf Deutsch.
